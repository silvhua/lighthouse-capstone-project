During the exploratory data analysis, some data entry errors were identified and corrected.
* The `Load80%1RM` feature used during data collection should be ~80% of the participant's `Load-1RM-1`. For one participant, the value was much lower than expected (0.8 x 197.5 = 177.75, but the value listed was 117.5), likely due to a data entry error. 

This incorrect value was replaced with 177.5 (closest weight increment to 80% of the `Load-1RM-1`)
